#### now fixed to compile with kernel 3.19.1 and tagged as version Sony Notebook Control Driver v0.9np11

#### now fixed to compile with kernel 3.15.3 and tagged as version Sony Notebook Control Driver v0.9np10

#### This is no 'official' version, I just copied the version found at https://gitorious.org/sony-laptop-zseries and changed it to compile with kernel 3.6.2 (by copy/pasting other changes). I have no idea what I did and if this really works, but it seems to be ok for me. Hope you will find this useful, Rene  ####
